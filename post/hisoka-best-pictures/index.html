Recommendations for watching anime you can. There are many different types of anime that can be enjoyed, so it really depends on what you&rsquo;re looking for in an anime. While there are some general tips that apply to all types of Anime, here are some specific recommendations for those who enjoy the genre of Anime:

-If you&rsquo;re looking for something more drawn out, try checking out OVA&rsquo;s or one-shots before getting into the full series. These episodes usually have less action and more atmosphere, which can add to your enjoyment while giving you more closure on the story.</p><h2 id=chrollo-lucilfer-header-edit--anime-hisoka-banner>Chrollo Lucilfer Header Edit | Anime, Hisoka, Banner<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#chrollo-lucilfer-header-edit--anime-hisoka-banner>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/03/35/ef/0335ef8a8d150804d9d771b167eabe89.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.1g6g2BtBiPiN-5I4qIkySQHaCe&pid=15.1"' alt="chrollo lucilfer header edit | Anime, Hisoka, Banner"><p><em>Source: br.pinterest.com</em></p><blockquote><p>chrollo lucilfer.</p></blockquote><p>The History of Wallpapers: From Ancient Times to Today
